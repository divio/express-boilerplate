===================
Express Boilerplate
===================

`Divio Cloud <http://www.divio.com/>`_ based boilerplate to develop with Express JS.

Up to date with `Express <https://expressjs.com/>`_ **4.16.4**.

The project files have been generated using `express-generator <https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html>`_.
An example database connection has been added to ``myapp/app.js`` from the Express
`guides <https://expressjs.com/en/guide/database-integration.html#postgresql>`_.


========
Database
========

The boilerplate uses ``pg-promise`` to talk to the database. A good example of the usage can be found `here <https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise-demo>`_.
